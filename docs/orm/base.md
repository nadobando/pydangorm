## BaseArangoModel Class Documentation

### Overview

The `BaseArangoModel` class forms the foundation for defining models in the `pydango` ORM that represent ArangoDB
entities. It provides core attributes, methods, and configurations to facilitate interactions with ArangoDB.

### Attributes

1. **`id`**: An optional unique identifier for the ArangoDB entity.
1. **`key`**: An optional unique key specific to ArangoDB entities.
1. **`rev`**: An optional revision attribute used in ArangoDB for versioning and conflict resolution.

### Nested Classes

- **`Config`**: Specifies configurations for the Pydantic model. It fine-tunes model behavior, especially regarding data
  validation and serialization.

- **`Collection`**: Offers collection-specific configurations for the model, customizing its behavior and settings in
  relation to ArangoDB collections.

### Methods

1. \*\*__init__(self, **data: Any)**: Initializes the model. If session data is provided, it sets the `__session__`
   attribute, linking the model to a specific session.

1. **\_decompose_class(cls, obj: Any)**: Decomposes or serializes the model. Customized to handle the specific needs of
   ArangoDB entities.

1. **\_calculate_keys(self, ...)**: Determines the keys for the model based on inclusion, exclusion, and other criteria.

1. **from_orm(cls, obj: Any, session=None)**: Constructs a model instance from an ORM object. Handles relationships and
   ensures that associated entities are correctly initialized.

1. \*\*update_forward_refs(cls, **localns: Any)**: Resolves and updates forward references in relationships and fields.

1. **save_dict(self)**: An abstract method to be implemented in derived classes. It outlines how the model data should
   be saved or serialized.

### Tips for Developers:

1. When creating a new model, consider extending the `BaseArangoModel`. It offers foundational attributes and methods
   tailored for ArangoDB.
1. Always specify relationships correctly. The `__relationships__` and `__relationships_fields__` attributes are central
   to the model's operation.
1. If working with forward references, ensure to call the `update_forward_refs` method after all models are defined to
   resolve and set up relationships.
1. Implement the `save_dict` method in derived classes to customize data saving or serialization behavior.
